# Style guide

[Use the code in the style guide folder](styleguide) to create a 'living' style guide that collects your final ideas about colours and typography based on your moodboards and parallel designs.

There is a zip file called `downloadable-version.zip` containing all the code for the style guide for easy downloading.

Add screenshots of each iteration of your style guide to this page.
