# User &amp; Competitor Research

## Submission Point One

SP1 is a collection of documents resulting from the web development processes undertaken during week 1. 

Formative feedback on these documents will be provided during your weekly meeting with the tutors, enabling you to make amendments before final submission.

The following documents should be presented:  

> These documents are assessed at the final submission.

- [Ideation Report](#Ideation-Report)
- [User Research Report](#User-Research-Report)
- [The Proposal](#The-Proposal)
- [Competitor Analysis](#Competitor-Analysis)

First, a few words about our use of Markdown and GitHub.

## Markdown

Most of the documents we are asking you to develop are in Markdown.

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Markdown is one of those _little_ skills you should have. It's also fun and easy to use. You can open and create `.md` documents in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown). Preview mode allows you to edit and view a document in your editor.

### Markdown Cheatsheet

[Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet on GitHub](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) has all you need to get started. He also links to some more detailed resources.

## Version Control

### Git

> Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

Using Git allows your team to manage both your documents and code for this assignment. Correctly used, version control allows multiple users to contribute to (or comment on) the same document (although this can get complicated). It also allows you to recover previous versions. Instructions and advice for use will be given in class.

### GitHub

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/)

GitHub is one of those things you _just need to know_ in digital. It can be complex. Teams can decide what level of use they want to make of GitHub throughout the project.

> We recommend you use GitHub to co-operate on documents rather than to _work on at the same time_.

Used correctly, making use of GitHub at the very least ensures all of your work is backed up.

> **Final word** - GitHub provides tutors (and team members) an unparalleled insight into the contributions of each team member.

## Ideation Report

Initial ideas - You will be introduced in class to the 'Crazy 8s' ideation technique, allowing the team to 'brainstorm' and define a number of initial ideas for the project web site (the Guide).

Write a short (300 word max) report outlining your ideation process.

Scan any resulting documents (photograph if too big) and save as .jpg files in the `sp1-media` folder.

Insert these images, provide captions to illustrate your ideation sessions.

## The Proposal

Project Proposal - You are required to create a Proposal (1000 words) that provides brief details of the web site you plan to construct. The ideation, meeting with tutors and user research will help inform this document.

The proposal becomes an agreement between your team and the client about vision and direction of the Guide.

## User Research Report

User Research - Undertake some initial user research with friends, family and fellow students to better understand what people would want from the guide you are proposing. Use the document provided which is based on a BBC User Research document.

Each team member should develop 2 or 3 user profiles. Note: these are not Personas (developed later). These should be based on real people.

You are trying to collect thoughts of 'real' people about the type of product you are about to build (and their experience of similar products). At this stage we are just collecting anything that may be useful - you can figure out what is actually useful later.

## Competitor Analysis

As a team, you are required to review 3 web sites that are similar to the type of site you are building. These sites may be local, UK-based or overseas (if relevant).

Analyse the 3 sites using the criteria on the Competitor Analysis document provided.

**The Competitor Analysis document is too complex for Markdown and is therefore supplied as an MSword document.**
