## Assessment overview

- Come up with an idea that’s [relevant to the brief](the-brief.md).
- [Create these documents](portfolio.md) to document why the website you will make works the way it does and why it has the content and design you’ve added to it.
- Make a prototype of the website that looks good and works well.

## Longer Assessment overview

> **IMPORTANT - [Read the assignment overview - The brief](the-brief.md)**.

The portfolio contains a variety of elements to be completed including the proposal, site plan, moodboards, quality audit and many other tools for site development. These are collected together into smaller sub-portfolios called submission points. Each teaching week we will review these documents, providing feedback and allowing you to make improvements. They will not be assessed until the submission at the end of the unit.

You will be submitting this repository which will contain your completed Portfolio and Guide website. All the elements are listed and should be [linked from portfolio.md](portfolio.md) to make your work easier to mark. **Use the list of documents on that page as a checklist prior to submission.**

## Submission point briefings

These documents outline the work you need to carry out each week. You will be working on these in class and in your own time. If you have any questions about these tasks, please ask us.

- [Submission Point 1](1_User_and_competitor_research/README.md) - Ideation & user research
- [Submission Point 2](2_Information_architecture/README.md) - Information architecture
- [Submission Point 3](3_Content_strategy/README.md) - Content strategy & writing for the web

- [Submission Point 6](6_Quality_assurance/README.md) - Quality assurance


## Project Management

**Each group should manage the web development process as a team.**

- We suggest that each group has an internal discussion in the first week about your different skills and interests as part of an ice-breaker. You could identify who likes managing, writing, coding and designing.

- There is no need to appoint an official 'project manager' but you should make sure that you have a process for coordinating these tasks.

- Be clear with each other what your strengths are, but at the same time allow people to develop their skills – enthusiasm and curiosity are important aspects of this assignment.

- Set frequent deadlines for all of the various elements of the project when relevant.

- Support each other by meeting each deadline with your personal contribution.

- Please meet at least twice a week in your groups (excluding class time) to coordinate your roles and activities. 

- Think about what needs to be done synchronously or asynchronously.

- Set up and agree communications channels. This will be based around MS Teams, but you may want to support this using oter channels.

- Record meetings and action points in the [Meetings log file](WSD-meetings-log.xlsx) on GitHub and track contributions via GitHub. If someone is failing to contribute their fair share to the group, manage this or discuss the issues with the tutors **urgently**.

## Guidelines for good Group Working

1. Everyone in the group should ensure that they can be contacted easily by other members of the group by giving them adequate contact information.

2. When working in a group, please treat other members of the group with courtesy and respect their opinions, even if you do not necessarily agree with them. Create an atmosphere where you all feel you can check and contribute to documents before submission.

3. You are expected to make a full and fair contribution to the work of the group.

4. When you agree to undertake a task that has been assigned to you by the group you must try work to the agreed deadline since failure to do so could impede the progress of the whole project.

5. You have the right, naturally, to challenge other’s opinions but please try to do it in a professional way.

6. It is your responsibility to attend all meetings arranged by the group to advance the project, and to arrive at those meetings on time. If you can’t attend a meeting of the group you should consider providing your input in written form and giving this to the other group members before the meeting.

7. If another member of your group tells you something in confidence, you should respect their wishes.
