# Quality Assurance

## Submission Point Six

SP6 is a collection of documents resulting from the web development processes undertaken during week 6. 

Formative feedback on these documents will be provided during your weekly meeting with the tutors, enabling you to make amendments before final submission.

The following documents should be presented:

## QA elements

- [Accessibility audit](#Accessibility-audit)
- [Quality audit](#Quality-audit)

### Final Documentation

- [Peer assessment](#Peer-assessment) as required
- [Individual statements](#Individual-statement)


## Testing the site to ensure quality

Quality assurance is essential for any finished product. In the 'real world' you don't want to be releasing a product (website) that contains errors and omissions.

As a student group, to maximise the potential for a good mark you need to:

- Ensure the project fulfils the requirements of the brief (by checking against the brief and marksheets).
- By testing the final 'live' site before submission using the tools and techniques listed below.

## Accessibility audit

The WebAIM WCAG 2 checklist helps you undertake an audit of your siteâ€™s accessibility (using the accessibility guidelines).

Three documents are provided.

- Use the [WebAIM WCAG 2 checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/WCAG2Checklist.pdf) to assess your site. Print a copy and tick or cross relevant boxes, then scan.
- Use the [WebAIM WCAG 2 support document](wcag/WCAG2_checklist_support.docx) to help you understand the checklist and what is relevant to your project.
- Use the [WCAG comments document](wcag/template_WCAG2_comments.docx) to record any issues addressed and actions taken. This document provides tutors with an insight into how you have managed the audit.

### Core accessibility issues for your submission:

1.  Use of semantic elements for page structure
1.  Good colour contrast
1.  Relevant alt text for images
1.  Skip links implemented on all pages
1.  Accessible form(s)

Create a single document containing your completed checklist and comments document.

## Quality audit

Test for quality. This includes html validation, coding, links, seo and metadata.

Undertake a speed test using one or more of the online tools. Identify and fix any over-sized images (prime cause of slow loading).

Validate and audit your CSS (looking for unused, redundant CSS).

Validate your HTML. Review your HTML - has it maintained a strong semantic structure? Look for simple negative things, like overuse of the `<br>` tag to create space (rather than using CSS as you should).

### Tools to try

1.  [Checkbot - Chrome extension](https://www.checkbot.io)
1.  [Google Test my site](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com)
1.  [HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
1.  [CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
1.  [Squoosh for online image optimisation](https://squoosh.app/)
1.  Test the readability of your site content using the [free version of readable.com](https://readable.com/)

Develop a short report using selected screenshots to provide evidence. Discuss any issues discovered and how they were tackled.

## Final Documentation

There are three remaining elements to complete the portfolio.

### Peer assessment if required

A percentage of the assignment marks are available for peer review. A team that has worked well would elect to share the marks evenly. A team that has one or more team members who have not fully contributed to the project can agree, as a team to redistribute the marks. More will be explained in class.

### Individual statements

This is a chance to discuss how you and your colleagues managed the project, what you learnt, and your individual critique of the final product.

As this statement is personal you are not required to display this as part of the Portfolio. Each statement is submitted to an individual dropbox on Moodle.

- Word count 500 words (+/- 10%).
- Use the [template MSWord document for your individual statement](individual_statement.docx).
- Each team member must upload their individual statement the the relevant dropbox on Moodle.
- Upload as a `pdf`. Use the following format: `groupNumber-mmuID.pdf` e.g. `group1-99883344.pdf`
