# Quality Audit

Including...

## HTML Validation

Quality and efficiency of your code. If you have implemented code that does not validate you need to explain why.

## CSS Validation

Quality and efficiency.

## Speed test (inc. optimisation of code and media)

Download speeds. Are there any _blockers_. Are images optimised?

## Readability testing

Test at least some of your text. Think of your type of users and the levels they would expect.

Also test your grammar and spelling as this will lose you credibility (**and marks**).

## SEO

Review your metadata (Checkbot will help) including page titles, meta description, link text, use of headings, use of keywords in your text.
